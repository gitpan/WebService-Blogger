=head1 NAME

WebService::Blogger - Interface to Google's Blogger service

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.14

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides interface to the Blogger service now run by
Google. It's built in object-oriented fashion with L<Moose>, which makes
it easy to use and extend. It also utilizes newer style GData API for
better compatibility. You can retrieve list of blogs for an account,
add, update or delete entries.

 use WebService::Blogger;

 my $blogger = WebService::Blogger->new(
     login_id   => 'myemail@gmail.com',
     password   => 'mypassword',
 );

 my @blogs = $blogger->blogs;
 foreach my $blog (@blogs) {
     print join ', ', $blog->id, $blog->title, $blog->public_url, "\n";
 }

 my $blog = $blogs[1];
 my @entries = $blog->entries;

 my ($entry) = @entries;
 print $entry->title, "\n", $entry->content;

 $entry->title('Updated Title');
 $entry->content('Updated content');
 $entry->categories([ qw/category1 category2/ ]);
 $entry->save;

 my $new_entry = WebService::Blogger::Blog->add_entry(
     title   => 'New entry',
     content => 'New content',
     blog    => $blog,
 );
 $new_entry->delete;


=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

 my $blogger = WebService::Blogger->new(
     login_id   => 'myemail@gmail.com',
     password   => 'mypassword',
 );

Connects to Blogger, authenticates and returns object representing
Blogger account. The credentials can be given in named parameters or
read from a configuration file which has contents like this:

 username = someone@gmail.com
 password = somepassword

The file is first searched for as $ENV{WEBSERVICE_BLOGGER_CONFIG} then
as "$ENV{HOME}/.www_blogger_rc". On Windows, please use the first format.

The file must not be accessible by anyone but the owner. Module will
die with an error if it is. Authentication token received will be
stored privately and used in all subsequent requests.

=cut

=head2 blogs

Returns list of blogs for the account, as either array or array
reference, depending on the context. Items are instances of
L<WebService::Blogger::Blog>.
